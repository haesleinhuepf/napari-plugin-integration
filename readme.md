# Report on Project "Seamless Integration of Quantitative Bio-Image Analysis Plugins"

On this page we summarize our efforts in the CZI funded project [Seamless Integration of Quantitative Bio-Image Analysis Plugins](https://chanzuckerberg.com/science/programs-resources/imaging/napari/seamless-integration-of-quantitative-bio-image-analysis-plugins/). The original plan was to support the napari plugin community by providing guidance in making napari plugins interoperable and to produce user-documentation across plugins. 

## Summary

Our project team consisted of [Mara Lampert](https://github.com/marabuuu) and [Robert Haase](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf). We produced various materials as visualized in this overview pie chart.

We opened about 60 Github issues and 18 pull-requests, commonly supporting napari-plugin developers in enriching their documentation and making their napari-plugins work on other computers. Also, we assisted plugin developers in making their plugins interoperable with each other. In this way we contributed to about 30 napari plugins, the napari-core and the [napari-hub](https://napari-hub.org) website.

## Highlights

Following our original goal, we provided napari-plugin documentation in form of blog-posts and videos that show how to work with multiple napari-plugins together.

As life scientists in our local environment commonly struggle with installing napari, we also wrote a blog-post outlining how to do this:
* [Getting started with mambaforge and Python](https://biapol.github.io/blog/mara_lampert/getting_started_with_mambaforge_and_python/readme.html)

As guidance for napari-plugin developers and data scientists more broadly, we wrote blog posts introducing them to good practices for user documentation, licensing and sharing.
* [Scientific Data Analysis: User Documentation 101](https://focalplane.biologists.com/2023/04/30/scientific-data-analysis-user-documentation-101/)
* [If you license it, it'll be harder to steal it](https://focalplane.biologists.com/2023/05/06/if-you-license-it-itll-be-harder-to-steal-it-why-we-should-license-our-work/)
* [Sharing research data with zenodo](https://focalplane.biologists.com/2023/02/15/sharing-research-data-with-zenodo/)

We also shared slides of our presentations online:

* [Bio-image analysis using Napari and Python](https://f1000research.com/slides/12-972)
* [Introduction to napari and the napari-assistant](https://f1000research.com/slides/12-937)
